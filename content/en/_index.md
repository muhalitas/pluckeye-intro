title: Plucky Introduction

This page is intended to provide a brief introduction to Plucky.  It does not describe Plucky in detail so that this page can be translated into many languages in a reasonable amount of time, and so that the translations do not all need to be updated when Plucky gains some new feature.

## What is Plucky?

Plucky is an Internet filter most often used to enhance self-control when using the Internet and less often used as a parental control tool to restrict what children have access to on the Internet.  It is highly configurable, and the classic configuration is rather extreme: it blocks all images, audio, and video from all web pages that have not been explicitly exempted by the end-user.

Plucky can be used on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.

## How to use the full Plucky manual.

The [Plucky manual](https://docs.pluckeye.net/) describes Plucky in more detail.  It is available in English only, but you can use an automated translation service such as [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) to read it in another language.

## How is Plucky spelled?

Plucky was originally named and spelled *Pluckeye*  after the principle described by Jesus in [Matthew 5:29](http://bib.ly/Mt5.29.KJV).  However, it has always been pronounced as *plucky* by the author because he had a friend named *Sunneye* whose name was pronounced *Sunny* and because he liked the playful pun.  In English *pluck* means *courage* as well as *to take out*.  You may seen references to *Pluckeye* (oldest), *Pluck* (middle), or *Plucky*, but they all mean the same thing.
